Example import files for game gear (532 files)

This example contains an unoptimized patch.txt file generated by romdb using:

  romdb -i "examples\game gear" -p "examples\game gear\patch.txt"

create a folder named "files" and put all files in it and run:

  romdb -o "game gear.db" -i "examples\game gear"

Use xz for compression:

  romdb -o "game gear.db" -i "examples\game gear" -c xz

Use a different files folder:

  romdb -o "game gear.db" -i "examples\game gear" -r "Z:\roms"
